## Signing up — email setup (SendGrid)

ashlr uses [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to send magic-link sign-in emails from
`noreply@ashlr.ai`. Before users can self-serve sign up, a domain-verified
sender must be configured:

1. Create a SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com and add your sending domain
   (e.g. `ashlr.ai`). Follow their
   [domain verification guide](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/sender-verification)
   to add the required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
2. Once the domain is verified, create an API key in the SendGrid dashboard
   (Developers > API Keys). Scope it to "Sending access" only.
3. Store the key as a Fly.io secret alongside your other server secrets:
   ```
   fly secrets set SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
   ```
4. Set the `FRONTEND_URL` secret to your site origin so magic-link URLs point
   to the right place (default: `https://plugin.ashlr.ai`):
   ```
   fly secrets set FRONTEND_URL=https://plugin.ashlr.ai
   ```

**Dev / test mode:** If `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is unset, or if `TESTING=1`, no email
is sent. The magic token is printed to stderr instead — safe for local
development and CI.

## Stripe webhook setup

After deploying the API server, register the billing webhook in the Stripe dashboard:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > Add endpoint.
2. Set the endpoint URL to `https://api.ashlr.ai/billing/webhook`.
3. Select the following events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. After saving, reveal the signing secret (`whsec_...`) and store it as a Fly.io secret:

```sh
fly secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... --app ashlr-api
fly secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... --app ashlr-api
```

5. Bootstrap Stripe products and prices (run once per environment):

```sh
fly ssh console --app ashlr-api -C "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=\$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY bun run src/cli/stripe-setup.ts"
```

The setup script is idempotent — re-running it is safe.

## 1. Vercel — site deployment

The `site/` Next.js app is deployed to Vercel via `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`. Pushes to `main` that touch `site/**` trigger a production deploy. Pull requests get a preview URL posted as a comment.

### Step 1 — Create the Vercel project

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in.
2. Click **Add New Project**, select your GitHub repo (`ashlrai/ashlr-plugin`).
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `site`.
4. Set the **Framework Preset** to `Next.js`.
5. Leave build/output settings at defaults — the workflow runs `bun run build` itself.
6. Click **Deploy** once to initialize the project (this first deploy can be ignored).

### Step 2 — Grab the three required tokens

All three values are on the project settings page in Vercel.

| Secret | Where to find it |
|--------|-----------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Account Settings > Tokens > Create (scope: Full Account) |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Project Settings > General > Team ID (shown at page top) |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Project Settings > General > Project ID |

### Step 3 — Add secrets to GitHub

In the GitHub repo, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**, then add:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

### Step 4 — Verify

Push any change under `site/` to `main`. The **Deploy site to Vercel** workflow should appear under Actions, run `bun run build`, then deploy. The Vercel dashboard shows the new deployment within ~2 minutes.

For pull requests, the workflow posts a preview URL comment. No additional configuration needed.

## 2. Fly.io — API server deployment

The `server/` Hono/Bun app is deployed to Fly.io via `.github/workflows/deploy-server.yml`. Pushes to `main` that touch `server/**` run tests first, then deploy.

### Step 1 — Install flyctl and log in

```bash
brew install flyctl          # macOS
# or: curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
flyctl auth login
```

### Step 2 — Launch the app (first time only)

```bash
cd server
flyctl launch --no-deploy
```

When prompted:
- **App name**: `ashlr-api` (must match `app` in `fly.toml`)
- **Region**: `iad` (US East, matches `primary_region` in `fly.toml`)
- **Postgres**: no (the server uses SQLite via Bun's built-in driver)
- **Redis**: no

This writes a `fly.toml` — the repo already has one, so confirm you want to keep the existing file.

### Step 3 — Get the API token

```bash
flyctl tokens create deploy -x 999999h
```

Copy the printed token. This is your `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

### Step 4 — Add the secret to GitHub

In GitHub repo > **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**, add:

- `FLY_API_TOKEN`

### Step 5 — Push and verify

Push any change under `server/` to `main`. The **Deploy server to Fly.io** workflow runs `bun test` first — if any test fails, the deploy is aborted. On success, `flyctl deploy --remote-only` builds and deploys the image remotely.

Verify with:

```bash
curl https://api.ashlr.ai/
# Expected: {"ok":true,"service":"ashlr-server","phase":1}
```

### Environment variables on Fly.io

Set any runtime secrets with:

```bash
flyctl secrets set KEY=value --app ashlr-api
```

Common secrets for Phase 1:
- `PORT` is set automatically by Fly.io via the internal port in `fly.toml`

---

## 3. DNS configuration

### plugin.ashlr.ai — Vercel

Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider:

```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  plugin
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL:   3600
```

Then in Vercel > Project Settings > Domains, add `plugin.ashlr.ai`. Vercel provisions a TLS certificate automatically via Let's Encrypt within ~2 minutes.

### api.ashlr.ai — Fly.io

Fly.io assigns a static IPv4 address. Get it with:

```bash
flyctl ips list --app ashlr-api
```

Add an A record:

```
Type:  A
Name:  api
Value: <Fly IPv4 address>
TTL:   3600
```

Then add the custom domain to Fly.io:

```bash
flyctl certs add api.ashlr.ai --app ashlr-api
```

Fly.io issues the TLS certificate automatically.

---

## 4. Smoke test

After every deploy, run the smoke test script to verify both services are healthy:

```bash
# Install endpoint only (no token required)
./scripts/deploy-smoke.sh

# Full test including badge and stats endpoints
ASHLR_TOKEN=<provisioned_token> ./scripts/deploy-smoke.sh

# Override URLs for staging
SITE_URL=https://preview.plugin.ashlr.ai \
API_URL=https://staging-api.ashlr.ai \
ASHLR_TOKEN=<token> \
./scripts/deploy-smoke.sh
```

The script exits with code `0` on full pass, `1` if any check fails. It is safe to run repeatedly. Checks performed:

- `GET /` on site — 200
- `GET /robots.txt` — 200
- `GET /sitemap.xml` — 200
- `GET /` on API — `{ok: true}` JSON
- `POST /stats/sync` — 200 (authenticated)
- `GET /stats/aggregate` — user_id present (authenticated)
- `GET /u/:userId/badge.svg` — SVG content with metric text

To provision a token for testing:

```bash
cd server && bun run issue-token
```

---

## 5. Rollback procedures

### Vercel rollback

The Vercel dashboard keeps every deployment permanently. To roll back:

1. Go to the project > **Deployments**.
2. Find the last known-good deployment.
3. Click the three-dot menu > **Promote to Production**.

Takes effect within 30 seconds globally.

Alternatively, revert the offending commit and push — the workflow redeploys automatically.

### Fly.io rollback

Fly.io keeps the previous machine image. Roll back instantly:

```bash
# List recent releases
flyctl releases list --app ashlr-api

# Roll back to a specific version number
flyctl deploy --image registry.fly.io/ashlr-api:<version> --app ashlr-api
```

Or revert the commit and push — the workflow redeploys the server automatically.

To monitor a rollback:

```bash
flyctl logs --app ashlr-api
```

## 6. Cost expectations

Cost figures below are derived from the Phase 1 architecture (Fly.io for compute, Neon serverless Postgres, Cloudflare R2/S3 for storage, Upstash Redis for rate limits).

| Component | 100 MAU | 1,000 MAU | 10,000 MAU |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Vercel (site hosting) | Free tier | Free tier | ~$20/mo (Pro) |
| Fly.io compute (ashlr-api, auto-scale to 0) | ~$3/mo | ~$8/mo | ~$30/mo |
| Postgres (Neon serverless) | ~$0.50/mo | ~$5/mo | ~$30/mo |
| S3 / R2 (stats backups, genome bodies) | ~$0.10/mo | ~$1/mo | ~$8/mo |
| Redis (Upstash, rate limits + cache) | $0 (free tier) | $20/mo (fixed) | $50/mo |
| Cloud LLM inference (Haiku, summarization) | ~$0.20/mo | ~$2/mo | ~$20/mo |
| Bandwidth + misc | ~$0.20/mo | ~$2/mo | ~$15/mo |
| **Total** | **~$4/mo** | **~$38/mo** | **~$173/mo** |

**At 1K MAU**, total infra is approximately **$38/month**. The MIT free tier carries no marginal cost per user for the open-source plugin itself; backend costs arise only from the Pro stats-sync and hosted badge features.

**At 10K MAU**, the architecture remains defensible. Beyond that, add Postgres read replicas and consider sharding by organization. See `docs/pro-backend-architecture.md` for the full cost model and scaling decision points.

**Fly.io specifics**: the `ashlr-api` app is configured with `auto_stop_machines = "stop"` and `min_machines_running = 0`. It scales to zero when idle, meaning zero compute cost at 0 requests. The first request cold-starts in ~500ms (Bun is fast). For production traffic, set `min_machines_running = 1` to eliminate cold starts at the cost of ~$3/mo for the always-on machine.
