## Known limitations

- 2 tests skipped: `no-genome grep` environment-leak flake and a benchmark ratio assertion (same root cause). Both pass in isolation; documented in-line.
- `rg` binary sensitivity: benchmark rg-resolution walks multiple candidate paths but may require `rg` to be a plain system binary in some environments.
- Small edits (< ~30 chars): `ashlr__edit` diff-summary overhead exceeds naive payload; ratio is 2.5x in the small-edit benchmark bucket.
