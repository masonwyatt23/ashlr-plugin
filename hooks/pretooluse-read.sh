# ashlr-plugin PreToolUse:Read enforcement hook.
#
# Blocks the built-in Read tool on files larger than 2KB and redirects the
# agent to ashlr__read, which returns a snipCompact-truncated view (head +
# tail, elided middle) saving ~60-95% of tokens on large files.
#
# Contract (Claude Code PreToolUse):
#   stdin  → JSON { tool_name, tool_input: { file_path, ... }, ... }
#   exit 0 → allow the built-in call
#   exit 2 → block; stderr is shown to the agent as a tool error
#
# Exceptions (pass-through):
#   - File < 2 KB (no meaningful savings)
#   - File does not exist or cannot be stat'd (let built-in produce the real error)
#   - Path is inside this plugin's own source tree (dogfooding / self-edits)
#   - $ASHLR_NO_ENFORCE=1 (global escape hatch)
#   - tool_input.bypassSummary === true (explicit override by agent)
#
# Design notes:
#   - Uses `bun -e` for JSON parsing (bun is already a plugin dependency).
#   - Single stat call, no other subprocess work, typical runtime <30ms.

# Enforcement is OFF by default. The hard-block via `exit 2` was too
# aggressive — it interrupted the user in `bypassPermissions` mode when all
# they wanted was a silent suggestion. `hooks/tool-redirect.ts` already
# injects an `additionalContext` nudge for large reads; that nudge is
# sufficient for the agent to route through ashlr__read on its next attempt.
#
# To re-enable hard enforcement (e.g. on CI where you want zero tolerance
# for full-file reads), set ASHLR_ENFORCE=1. `ASHLR_NO_ENFORCE=1` remains
# honored for backwards compatibility with anyone scripting against the
# old flag name.
